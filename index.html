                <p align="justify">Situated well away from the din of the city life and surrounded by tall and lush green shady trees, Govt. College of science, Wahdat Road, Lahore is one of the first rank academic institutions of the Punjab. The institution has attained this status after 48 years of persistent efforts and prolong struggle. The college, by its present name came into being on 8th August 1973,in compliance with the orders of the then Governor of the Punjab, after merging Government Superior Science College, Lahore and Government Degree College, Wahdat Road, Lahore. At the same time the building which was constructed to house Govt. Intermediate college for Girls, Gulberg, Lahore and which remained unutilized, was also annexed to the college building and was named Government College of Science, Wahdat Road, Lahore. Thus Government College of Science emerged from the blend of these three institutions and a renowned educationist, Prof. M.A. Saeed was appointed its first principal. </p>
